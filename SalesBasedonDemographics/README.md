# Sales Analysis Based on Demographics

## Overview
This project presents an exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualization of sales data segmented by demographic factors. The analysis aims to uncover patterns and insights into how different demographic groups influence sales performance. The notebook uses Python libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to process, analyze, and visualize the data.
